            Hello! Iâ€™m Sophat Sophana. Currently, I am a computer science student, who loves the fields of robotics and software
            engineering. Apart from coding, I enjoy playing soccer and exploring new. Since middle
            school, photography has allowed me to connect with the world and my surroundings.
            Furthermore, I like to give back to the community by volunteering for various programs.
            Also, I want to push myself outside my comfort zone by attending boot camps to improve
            my skills and learn more from the program and other participants. I am hard-working and
            focused on my tasks, but sometimes if I have too much pressure, I will pull myself out and
            then continue on my work.
